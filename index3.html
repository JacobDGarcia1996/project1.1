        Ada Lovelace</a>
        <p>this is the first asignment done for the class.
        it is a small summary of a famous computer programmer,
        along with short facts and an image.
        this first assignement uses the basic pricibals of html setup.
         with elements such as <span> tittle, heading, paragraph, image, link,
         lists, and text formating</span>. later on it would become an updated
         version to help us learn the aspects of <span>Div and
         Style</span> tags and how to incorperate color and backgrounds.</li>
      <li class="file"><a href="apologies.html">About Chico</a>
      <p>This piece focused more on styling the formats and color of text.
         its a simple assignment change and add a few lines of code so that the
         piece has different fonts and text coloring.</p></li>

      <li clas="file"><a href=apologies.html>"Movie Spoilers</a>
      <p> During this assignment we were to construct a review of our favorite movies.
        how ever we were not allowed to use style tags.
      In its place we were to convert all our styles to a seperate <span>CSS file.</span>
    the whole purpose was to expose us to <span>CSS formating and how it can be incorperated</span>.
  this proved difficult to understand at first and requiered the assitence of the proffesor.
stil it proves useful and can be used in numerous ways.</p></li>

        Making Tabs</a>
      <p> This is short and sweet the purpose was to establich tabs that could
        navigate to other file and locations</p></li>
      <li class="file1"><a href="file:///C:/Users/jacob/OneDrive/Documents/cins%20110-1/MySchedule/index.html">
        My Schedule</a>
      <p> This is a review of our ability to preform <span>CSS file</span> codes and as well
        as our first exposure to <span>html table</span> and tags like <span>hover</span>.the purpose was
         to have us make a table with a pre provided schedule and seperate the
         rows by color and change the color of the text. the tricky part is using
         the hover comand and having the segment that is hovered over by the mouse
          change color in both background and text color.</p>
